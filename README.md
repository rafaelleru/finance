# Finance

This program is an intent to help me to track my daily expenses. I have tried ledger, google and excel sheets, etc
but none of them have the low fiction of the cli interface for me so I always ended up leaving the habit of tracking
my expenses.

This tool is suposed to follow the \*NIX filosofy so it will delegate in well known programs such as cat, git, grep...
