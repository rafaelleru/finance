# Finance

This program is an intent to help me to track my daily expenses. I have tried ledger, google and excel sheets, etc
but none of them have the low fiction of the CLI interface for me and I always ended up leaving the habit of tracking
my expenses.

This tool is supposed to follow the \*NIX philosophy so it will delegate in well-known programs such as cat, git, grep...
